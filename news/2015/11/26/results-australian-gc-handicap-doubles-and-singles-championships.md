These were held from Monday 2 to Saturday 6 November.  Fortunately the threatening heavy rain fell outside play.  Deniliquin was using their grass tennis courts and managed to keep 4 courts in action (6 courts most of the time).

Winners of the Doubles were Jim & Val Saunders (Belmont-Geelong CC), a game clear of Ross & Helen Rillie (Headland-Buderim CC).

Ross Rillie also won the Singles, 7-6 in the third, from Kyle Mula (Deniliquin CC) who won last year.

Kyle, and his brother Lachlan, both were brought in from GC 4 to GC 2 during this tournament.  

Doug Leabeater (Young CC) won the Egyptian/Plate event.

This is a great event which was enlivened by a very successful Melbourne Cup luncheon - friendly people, a well-run Club, and handicap play using extra turns allowing players across a range of handicaps to challenge for the trophies.  It will be in Deniliquin again next year in early November - put it in your diaries!
