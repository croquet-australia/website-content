<br/>Australia and New Zealand are two countries close in so many ways, yet, when it comes to sport there is a fearsome rivalry. 

In keeping with this tradition eight of Australia’s top Golf Croquet players – Peter Landrebe (Captain) NSW, Kevin Beard VIC, Chris McWhirter WA, John van der Touw VIC, Wendy Dickson VIC, Rosie Landrebe NSW, Anne Quinn VIC and Alison Sharpe NSW – fly across the Tasman to Nelson in New Zealand’s South Island on Friday to play for the inaugural Golf Croquet Trans-Tasman Trophy.

<br/>Our players have been preparing for several months and they are ready to go into battle and vie for a place in the croquet history books.

Who will hold the Trophy high in six days time?
