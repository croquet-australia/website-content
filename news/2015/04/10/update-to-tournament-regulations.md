The new wording is -

12.7	Players are to wear either Club, State, Regional, National and/or International uniforms or predominantly white clothing.  Additionally Players can wear Event specific shirts.  Flat-soled shoes are to be worn ie the soles of which do not mark the court.  Players choosing to wear sandals shall, as all players should, be conscious of surrounding play in order to ensure their own safety.  A Player presenting at the venue in unsuitable clothing will be given the opportunity to dress appropriately or will not be permitted to participate in the event.

This change comes into effect immediately.
