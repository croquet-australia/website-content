In 2014 The Patron's Trophy went to the West for the first time and was hosted by Moorabinda Croquet Club.  The spirit was convivial and collegiate.  Players commented that it was "the best Patron's ever!"  Take the time to explore the south west and perhaps spend a few days at Margaret River only an hour's drive away from Bunbury.
