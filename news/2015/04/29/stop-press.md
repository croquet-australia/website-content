Change to Dress Code

Earlier this month an amendment, as agreed by the previous Executive, was made to Tournament Regulation 12.7 – Responsibilities of Players and posted on the ACA Website dated 10 April, 2015.

The Board is aware that this change has caused much consternation and fervour within the croquet world.

The Board has agreed to suspend this amendment immediately pending further discussion among its Members as well as undertaking a full consultation with the Events and Tournament Committees.  The wording reverts to 

‘**Players are to wear neat and appropriate sporting attire** and flat-soled shoes ie shoes, the soles of which do not mark the court. Players choosing to wear sandals shall, as all players should, be conscious of surrounding play in order to ensure their own safety. A player presenting at the venue in unsuitable attire will be given the opportunity to dress appropriately or will not be permitted to participate in the event’.
