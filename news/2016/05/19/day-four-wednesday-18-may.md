Things were looking grim at the start of our semi-final against Latvia. We lost one of the two singles and were behind in the doubles, so we were in danger of being down two matches to one at lunchtime. However, a great fight back by Anne and Wendy in the doubles turned things around. In the afternoon everyone played magnificently and we did not drop another game. We are now into the final which will consist of 13 best-of-three matches held over two days at Bath CC. We are not sure at this stage who our opponents will be. When our matches finished it was two-all in the other semi-final, with Spain in the lead in two of the last three matches against Germany (and one match just starting). The team was exhausted after our great effort and decided to go home rather wait and watch to see who our opponents would be. Hopefully CroquetScores will tell us. Whoever it is, we are well prepared.
