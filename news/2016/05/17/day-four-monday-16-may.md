Today we were at the picturesque Camden & Peasedown club to play Switzerland. We had a very comfortable six matches to nil win but there were a couple of tough battles along the way. Lester and Anne fought back from 1-4 down in the first game of their doubles to win 7-5 before taking complete control to win the second game 7-1. Anne had trouble finding her rhythm in her singles game against a strong contender for the title of world's slowest player. All three games were very close before Anne did a brilliant jump shot at hoop ten in the third and wrapped up the match at the next hoop.

Before the games Chris and Wendy were interviewed by two different BBC radio stations. They did a great job. Some filming was done which was shown at the end of the 6:30 news on BBC TV. We were shown having breakfast. Actually, the camera crew was late arriving, so we had already had breakfast, but Captain Chris showed his leadership qualities by having a second breakfast. Other team members pretended to shovel in muesli from empty cereal bowls. The BBC also filmed the start of our first games against Switzerland.

The above is Chris McWhirter playing his first shot of the day against Switzerland while being filmed by a BBC camera man. The camera man filmed while the first three hoops were played. Shortly after he stopped filming Chris ran hoop four from 20 yards.

Although we are now guaranteed to make the semi-finals, we are keen to do well at Bath tomorrow against Germany, who are also undefeated.

We are very grateful for the many messages of support the team has received from players in Australia.
