During the Australian Golf Croquet Singles and Doubles Championships which were played in Victoria at the Cairnlea Croquet Complex from 7 – 15 May, 2016 the opportunity was taken during a dinner BBQ to farewell the Australian Golf Croquet Team bound for the UK and the World Team Championships.

Jim Saunders and Graeme Thomas represented the ACA Board and presented apologies from Robyn Wallace and other absent directors.  

The team have the challenge of endeavouring to win the Tier 2 section of the Championship and, if successful, to take Australia into Tier 1, the premier section of World GC Team competition.  The team comprises Chris McWhirter (captain), Wendy Dickson, Anne Quinn and Lester Hughes with John van der Touw, team manager and travelling reserve.
