The lead-up and practice is over and the competition has begun. We had a nervous start as we lost a game in both of our doubles matches against the Czech Republic, but steadied to win them both 2-1. In the afternoon we had a few scares but everyone held their nerve and finished strongly. We won all our singles matches 2-0 to have a very satisfactory six matches to nil victory over the Czech Republic.

Tomorrow morning [Monday 16 May] a cameraman and reporter from the BBC will film and interview us at breakfast. There will be a live radio feed as well. The camera man will also go to Camerton & Peasedown to film some of our games. The filming part will be edited and shown on TV in the evening news.

Tomorrow’s matches will be against Switzerland. On Tuesday we return to Bath to play Germany, the number three seed. The number two seed is Spain, who are in the other block of four, so we won’t meet them before the knockout stage. Spain also had a 6-0 win (against Latvia).
