The team arrived in Bath late yesterday afternoon [Wednesday 11 May] and checked into Minerva Apartments which are very conveniently located in the centre of town. Our new home has numerous bedrooms, bathrooms kitchens and lounge rooms spread over at least five floors. There are lots of restaurants and shops nearby. We were all very tired and went to bed early after dinner at the local pub.

Today [Thursday 12 May] will be a rest day as we try to get over jet-lag. Tomorrow we will practice at Bristol and Nailsea Croquet Clubs, both of which are about 25 km from Bath, and both of whom kindly offered us the use of their courts when I wrote to them a couple of months ago.

The next day (Saturday) is the official practice day, so we will probably spend some time at each of the hosting clubs (Bath and Camerton & Peasedown).
