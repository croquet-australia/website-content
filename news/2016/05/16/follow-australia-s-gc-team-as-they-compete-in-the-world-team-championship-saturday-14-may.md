We went to Bristol in the morning yesterday [Friday 13 May] and Nailsea in the afternoon. Thanks again to those clubs for their friendliness and hospitality in allowing us to use their courts for practice. Saturday was the official practice day and we went to Camerton & Peasdown in the morning. The courts were very slow and not particularly flat. The players will have to adjust their games accordingly. We practiced at Bath CC in the afternoon. Their courts were also fairly slow, but not as slow as C & P.

Tomorrow we play our first match against the Czech Republic at the Bath courts.
