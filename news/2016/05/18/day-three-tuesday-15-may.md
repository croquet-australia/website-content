Germany was our toughest opponent so far but we managed to beat them five matches to one, and that one loss was incredibly close: 7-6, 6-7, 6-7. Spain beat Lavia (also 5-1), so the semi-finals will be as predicted by the seedings, i.e.

<br/>Australia (Seed 1) v Latvia (Seed 4)
<br/>Spain (Seed 2) v Germany (Seed 3)

These matches will be played at Camden & Peasedown. The format is unusual. There are seven matches so that, weather permitting, a draw is impossible. In the morning Anne and Wendy will play doubles, and Lester and Chris will play singles. All four will play singles in the afternoon.
