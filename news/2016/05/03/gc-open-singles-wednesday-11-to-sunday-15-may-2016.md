The singles will be as per the past two years, two blocks (13 in each) playing single 13 point games, preferably played over the first 2 days (but could have one game carried over if 13 rounds in 2 days is too much), before top 8 of each block proceed to finals, Bo3 for F16 & Quarters on day 3, then Bo5 Semi (day 4) & Final (day 5).
