The doubles will commence with one large block of 17, playing single 13 point games, before proceeding to knockout phase.  Block positions are determined by games, net hoops, then who beat who as per usual (unfortunately there is no time for playoffs).  The top two pairs at the end of the block are placed 1 and 2 seeds in a semi final draw (i.e. top half and bottom half), then pairs finishing 3-6 play a single round knockout (19 point) with 3v6 and 4v5 at the end of block play on day 3 - the two winners of this 19pt knockout move into the Bo3 semi-final (13 point games) against the top 2 from the block as above.
