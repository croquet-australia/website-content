Play in Tier 2 finished on Friday 20 May in Bath, which gave our Team the opportunity to watch the final day’s play of the Tier 1 competition in Surbiton. John van der Touw sent the following summary 

New Zealand beat Egypt in the final 7 matches to 5 to win the World GC Teams Championship.

New Zealand was leading by two matches (4-2) at the end of the first day but the margin was cut to one match (5-4) by lunchtime on the last day with four singles matches to go.

Egypt won the first of the singles matches to level the scores when Ahmed Nasr beat Duncan Dixon, but New Zealand got back the lead with a win by Jenny Clarke over Mohamed Karem. New Zealand now had to win just one of the two remaining matches. Phillip Drew beat Hamy Erian 7-6, 7-6 to do that. The other match was abandoned since NZ now had an unbeatable lead.

As if that wasn't exiting enough, South Africa had to beat Wales in order to avoid relegation. The overnight score was three matches all with three to play on the last day, and it was four all at lunchtime on the last day. Ian Burridge had a chance to wrap it up for Wales with a 2-0 victory over William Louw in the final match but missed a four footer from directly in front. This not only cost him the hoop, but eventually the game, match and test. The final score in that match was South Africa 6-7, 7-6, 7-6. Thus Wales is relegated and South Africa keeps its place in T1 by the narrowest margin.
