 <p>The Association Croquet Selection Committee (ACSC) met on 3 April 2016 to determine its timetable and process for selecting the Australian team for the 2017 MacRobertson Shield, which will be played at the <a href="http://www.clubcorp.com/Clubs/Mission-Hills-Country-Club/">Mission Hills Country Club</a> in Rancho Mirage, California, USA from 18 April â€“ 4 May 2017.</p>
<p>The ACSC has agreed it will select the Australian team for the 2017 MacRobertson Shield in May 2016. The ACSC believes selection of the team at this time will provide team members with the optimal time to plan and prepare for their participation in the event.</p>
<p>The ACSC will meet again in May 2016 to select the team. When it does so, the ACSC will use the process and selection criteria set out in the ACA Selection Policy (July 2012).</p>
<p>Finally, as provided for by clause 6.2.3 of the selection policy, when selecting the team the ACSC will be considering player performance in:</p>
<ul>
<li>events dating from March 2014 and including the 2016 AC World Croquet Championships (2016 Worlds). The fact that a player does not participate in the 2016 Worlds will not exclude a player from consideration for selection in the team; and</li>
<li>for relevant players, the 2014 MacRobertson Shield held in New Zealand.</li>
</ul>
