Firstly thank you to players for their expressions of interest to be considered to play in the President’s AC Eights.  

The ACA Board is meeting on Friday 12 August and an item on the agenda is to review several recommendations from the AC Selection Committee.  These outcomes may influence the awarding of wild cards and the conditions of play for the first eight.

Letters of invitation will be distributed towards the end of next week.
