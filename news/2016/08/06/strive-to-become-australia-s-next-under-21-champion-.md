The second Australian Under 21 Golf Croquet Championship is a unique opportunity to hone skills against players of similar age and experience particularly as this event is being held at the Victorian Croquet Centre, Cairnlea, Victoria which is also the venue for the World Croquet Federation’s Under 21 GC World Championship in February 2017.

The winner will be awarded the Australian Under 21 Golf Croquet Perpetual Trophy, gold medal and a PFC Hoop Maker Mallet made to their specifications and kindly donated by Peter Cole.  Runner Up receives the silver medal.
