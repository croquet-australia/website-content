The Golf Croquet National Championships, held in Perth, finished over a week ago and ACA wishes to obtain feedback from not only those people who played or refereed but also from players who did not participate and why – have you competed in this event previously but not in 2016?

Your input is invaluable and it will assist with future improvements to national events.
