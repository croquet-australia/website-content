The ACA is offering two $500 scholarships in both AC and GC.

Expressions of interest are being sought from players wishing to be considered for one of these four scholarships which will be awarded based on the following - 

<br/>- emerging players with high level playing skills. For example good roqueting, break-making, peeling skills, and good understanding of 3-ball game tactics, etc and who have the potential to play at national and international levels

<br/>- established players with high level playing skills who are under consideration for international selection and/or representation.

<br/>The EOIs will be assessed against these two criteria and the Selectors' recommendations will be approved by the Board.

If you wish to be considered for an AC Scholarship please send your email to [Stephen Richards, Chair AC Selectors](mailto:acselectors@croquet-australia.com.au)

If you wish to be considered for a GC Scholarship please send your email to [Terrence Ericson, Chair GC Selectors](mailto:glenleslie@bigpond.com).

**Closing date for EOIâ€™s is Friday 28 October**

Please note, depending on the strength of claims in the EOIs, the Selectors may choose to recommend none, one or two scholarships for either code.

Players who have previously inquired about scholarships do need to follow this process.
