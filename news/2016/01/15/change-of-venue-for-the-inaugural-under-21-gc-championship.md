Sydney and the Hunter Valley Region have been deluged by rain over the past 24 hours and unfortunately Maitland Croquet Club is one of the casualties.  The Club was to host the Inaugural Under 21 Golf Croquet Championship and now with unplayable lawns the event has been moved to the National Park Croquet Club in Newcastle.

Croquet Australiaâ€™s sympathies go to the Maitland Croquet Club as its members had spent much time and energy preparing their courts for this tournament, and gratitude and thanks goes to the National Park Croquet Club who have been kind enough to come to the rescue.

Anyone wishing to see some of the most talented young croquet players in Australia are more than welcome to visit the club located at 25 National Part Street, Hamilton East.
