Several potential breaches of the Australian Croquet Association (ACA) Code of Behaviour have come to the attention of the ACA Board.  
The Board considers that all participants in the Sport of Croquet should be reminded of their agreement to abide with the Code of Behaviour. The Code of Behaviour, as part of the Member Protection Policy is there to allow all participants to enjoy participation without being subject to duress. 

In particular, the following points from the Member Protection Policy are relevant â€“ 

Code of Behaviour
The ACA requires every individual and organisation bound by this policy to:
B1: 1 Respect the rights, dignity and worth of others.
B1: 2 Be fair, considerate and honest in all dealings with others.
B2: 1 Respect the rights, dignity and worth of other players, coaches, officials and spectators.

ACA encourages all members to read the Code of Behaviour which can be found on the ACA website under the Member Protection Policy. The ACA will be less tolerant with breaches of this Policy in the future.

Regards

ACA Board
