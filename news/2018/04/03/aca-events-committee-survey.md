The ACA Events Committee has prepared a survey to check reactions to the recent AC championships played in Adelaide.

We are interested in why players did not go, as well as feedback from those who did.

Please spare a few minutes to respond to the survey by 30 April - depress the CTRL key and click on the link below to access the survey.

An e-mail is also being sent direct to the players who went to Adelaide, but feel free to mention this survey on to anyone else who might be interested in responding â€“ the more feedback, the better!

Queries re the survey should go to Peter Tracey ACA Events, +61 4 1967 2655. [Peter Tracey](mailto:peter.tracey@bigpond.com) or to [Croquet Australia](mailto:events@croquet-australia.com.au)
