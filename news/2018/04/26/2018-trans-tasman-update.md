Trans Tasman Report: Test 1.

The Trans Tasman Test Series (between Australia and New Zealand) is currently being held at the Wynnum Croquet Club in Brisbane, Queensland. The lawns are excellent, the members and volunteers both friendly and helpful, and the teams have been getting on marvellously.

The series is being played in the format of three 2-day tests, each consisting of 4 mixed doubles matches, and 8 singles matches - men play men and women play women. All matches are best-of-three, and one day is allocated to each match. 

Test 1 started off well for Australia, winning three of their four doubles games in straight matches against - losing the fourth closely in 3 games. Players from both sides seemed to take a while to get used to the lawn-speeds and warm themselves into some good play, but most (of the Australians at least) put in good performances for day 1 on foreign courts.

Day two was more hotly contested, with the New Zealanders lifting their games and pushed most of the Australians in good competitive matches - Australia winning the day, 5 matches to 3, and the first Test 9 matches to 3. A great start for the Aussies, but the New Zealanders look like making it a good competitive series, and any lull in form from either side will no doubt be pounced upon by the opposing side.
