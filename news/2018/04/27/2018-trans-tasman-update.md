Trans Tasman Report: Test 2.

If the First Test was a case of Australia getting off to a flying start in the doubles, followed by New Zealand making a valiant comeback and making it a real contest on the singles, the Second Test was the exact opposite.

On the first day, the Kiwis continued their upward form and took out three of the four doubles matches, putting the high-flying Australian team on the back foot. The NZ women put in particularly good performances, and this, I think, combined with a slight lapse in Australian concentration & confidence after NZ's rallying the day before, made the Second Test a very tight one. Thankfully for the Australians, the team was able to knuckle down and come back to win six of the eight singles matches (several going to a tight third game), and to take the Test, 7 games to 5, and thus the Series 2 Tests to 0, with one Test still to come.

Nevertheless, the New Zealanders put in a sterling effort, and could easily have won or drawn the Second Test. The Australians will certainly have to keep focusing their concentration to win the third test. With nothing to lose, I expect the New Zealanders to put up a very good fight.
