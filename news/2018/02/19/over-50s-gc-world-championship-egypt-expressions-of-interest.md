The World Croquet Federation Over 50s Golf Croquet World Championships will be held in Egypt in October 2018.  There will only be 48 places to be filled.

We must nominate Australian Players by late March.

If you would like to compete then please send an expression of interest NOW to [Croquet Australia](mailto:croquet.australia@gmail.com).

Expressions of interest must be received by 15 March and late expressions will not be considered.

in your expression of interest , you should indicate whether you are interested in a ranking spot, a member spot or a wildcard.  Players may put in an expression of interest for all three placements.

If they are nominating for a wildcard, then a brief resume of  attributes should be presented - the criteria will be for either exceptional talented players or country equalisation.

The first day of the event is when you are required to be 50 , so current 49 year olds can still nominate as long as their birthday is before the first day of play.
