It has been brought to my attention that some members have experienced difficulties accessing the tournament entry form for the GC Handicap Event in Adelaide. If you are unable to access the form via the website and are still interested in entering the Singles or Doubles events, please donâ€™t hesitate contacting the [ACA office](mailto:admin@croquet-australia.com.au). ACA apologies for any inconvenience.
