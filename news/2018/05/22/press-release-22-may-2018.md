UPDATE ON ENTRY FEES AND TOURNAMENT PRIZE MONEY
Executive Officer – Rob Murray

Tuesday, May 22, 2018 – Following the recent Association Croquet Australian Championships in Adelaide, ACA has received several complaints regarding both the increase in entry fees as well as the removal of all prize money to the winners of these tournaments. Back in December last year the ACA board made the decision to increase the entry fees for all ACA sanctioned tournaments and remove all prize money. This decision was not made lightly and was purely the result of budget constraints. The removal of prize money is only meant to be a temporary change until sponsorship can be sourced for these events.

These budget changes were communicated via the December 7 Board Meeting Minutes on the website. These budget items were discussed in detail at the AGM and were accepted by all State Delegates.  The changes to the tournament entry conditions were clearly indicated on the flier advertising the tournaments, indicating that there was no prize money being offered.  However, ACA accepts that these changes to the event could have been better communicated to members, officers, committees and players.  Notwithstanding this, ACA believes that the flier advertising the Events was sufficient advice of this change.

In the future ACA will endeavour to communicate these types of issues more thoroughly to its members, players and tournament management through the website and social media.

Any further queries regarding this matter should be directed to Executive Officer, Rob Murray at croquet.australia@gmail.com or 0457 678 380
