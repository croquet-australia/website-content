Australia's win over England in the first test was their first over England since 1935, when Australia last won the Mac. Australia have won the Mac 3 times with all 3 wins taking place in Melbourne, Australia.

The last time Australia beat the CA's side was in the final test in 1986 at Colchester, when the CA's side played as Great Britain. Ironically that match was the last one Robert Fulford had not played in before the current match.

Since 21 match tests were introduced in 1990 the most matches Australia had previously won against England/GB was 7 in 2010. Overall Australia had previously beaten England/GB 4 times in 41 tests; drawing 3 and losing 34.

England have now lost two Mac tests in a row for the first time since 1951. Great Britain never lost two in a row.
