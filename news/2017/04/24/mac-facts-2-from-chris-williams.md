Greg Fletcher became the second player, after Mark Saurin in 1990, and the first Australian, to win all 5 matches on his debut in the MacRobertson Shield.

Since 21 match tests were introduced in 1990 there have been 7 tests which have ended 11-10. New Zealand have been involved in 5 of them and this was the first time they have won one; having previously lost 3 times to Great Britain and once to Australia by that score.

David Maugham has now won 75 matches in the Mac; only Robert Fulford on 93 has won more. David has played 105 matches in that time and should overtake Robert Fulford's 111 during the final test.
