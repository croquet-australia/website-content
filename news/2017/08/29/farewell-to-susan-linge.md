Farewell and thank you Susan Linge, Croquet Australia's Administration Officer and Secretary to the Board. 
 
The following words are from Peter Freer and reflect the sentiment of the board current and past, the officers of ACA and all the State Administration and members. Susan, thank you for your service. We wish you all the very best for your future..... “Today is Susan Linge’s last day as ACA Sec/Admin Officer – she has resigned after just over 5 years in the role. I’ve had a fair bit to do with Susan in that time, and I have admired her enthusiasm, drive & people skills. Her knowledge of croquet has grown over this period, but she still occasionally surprises me by not knowing some croquet lore that the rest of us take for granted. This brought a fresh perspective to the position, and made sure Susan was less likely to be seen as partisan or beholden to any State or other group. This is a complex job, and there have been disagreements over what it should involve from the point of view of the various Executives/Boards; from office holders, from players, and of course from Susan. I wish the Board well in sorting out where to go next, but I consider that a clearer set of agreed priorities for this position is essential. Susan’s main fault was trying to do everything, and – while she almost always added value to what she was doing – the price was being a bit slower to do what each of us demanded that she do next. 
 
 
 
I consider her main success was remaining cheerful & positive for 5 years, despite the pressure, and issues in her own life. Susan would probably consider getting the ACA finances structured, and providing budgets to each area, as her main achievement. Necessary, and we can now all debate what the respective allocations should be – but at least we have a framework. Susan also arranged (with Tim Murphy) to get on-line entry onto the ACA website, which I consider a major improvement over players sending in paper entry and cheques. I wish Susan the very best in her next stage of life – sorting out some plumbing issues in Townsville seems to be looming large. Thank you, Susan.” ****
