Australian players are asked to register their interest no later than Sunday 9 July via the ACA website https://croquet-australia.com.au/tournaments/2018/ac/wcf-world-championship-eoi.

Names will be forwarded to the AC Selection Committee. Australia is required to send the list of names to the WCF by Sunday 30 July which will also include names of those players wanting to nominate for a Wild Card Place.

The WCF on Sunday 27 August will announce those players who have been awarded Ranking Places and Wild Places.

The ACA wishes to advise that from 1 January 2018, players will no longer receive financial support i.e. contribution and entry fees with the exception of players under the age of 21 commencing. ACAâ€™s focus will be team events such as the MacRobertson Shield, GC Teams and both the AC and GC Trans Trasman.
