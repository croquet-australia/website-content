At 8 o’clock Australian time on Thursday 4 May, Australia won croquet’s most coveted prize – the MacRobertson Shield.  The tournament is named after Australian Sir MacPherson Robertson, philanthropist, entrepreneur and founder of confectionary company MacRobertson’s.

The first ever ‘test’ was between England and Australia in 1925 and Robertson presented England, the champions, with a shield which became known as the MacRobertson Shield.  Australia last won the Shield in 1935.

It is fought over between the four major croquet nations – England, New Zealand, United States of America and Australia.  The competition is gruelling – seventeen days, 3 five-day tests and 21 matches.  In all 63 matches are played in a combination of doubles pairings and singles.

Australia’s team is Ian Dumergue, Captain, Stephen Forster, Simon Hockey, Robert Fletcher (currently number one in the world and former world champion), Malcolm Fletcher and Greg Fletcher; three brothers make up half the team.  Team Manager is Peter Landrebe.  Play began on Tuesday 18 April against England at Rancho Mirage in California.  Australia was the victor – 12 matches to 9.  The second test was against New Zealand and the result was 14 matches to 7 in our favour.  

With only one day to go in the final test, Australia is playing host country, USA and has an unassailable lead 12 to six

Australia is on the brink of creating history making its first win in living memory – a drought of 82 years to come to an end as Australia wins the third test with a day to still to play/

The Shield is coming home before Australia hosts the next MacRobertson Shield in 2021.
