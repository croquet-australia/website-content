The Patron’s Trophy is unique in the Australian Croquet calendar and is being held in the picturesque town of Bunbury, a vibrant coastal town 175 kilometres south of Perth.

The tournament is over the Queen’s Birthday long weekend – Saturday 11 to Monday 13 June and is bookended by Croquet West’s AC State Open Singles and Open Doubles (for more information see

Players who have participated previously all comment that the three days are fiercely competitive but conducted with great sportsmanship, respect and friendship.

Members of Moorabinda Croquet Club are generous hosts with both evening meals and luncheons available for purchase.
