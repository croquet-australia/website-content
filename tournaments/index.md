#Strive to become Australia's next under 21 Champion!

The second Australian Under 21 Golf Croquet Championship is a unique opportunity to hone skills against players of similar age and experience particularly as this event is being held at the Victorian Croquet Centre, Cairnlea, Victoria which is also the venue for the World Croquet Federation’s Under 21 GC World Championship in February 2017.

The winner will be awarded the Australian Under 21 Golf Croquet Perpetual Trophy, gold medal and a PFC Hoop Maker Mallet made to their specifications and kindly donated by Peter Cole.  Runner Up receives the silver medal.

#Go West – Go Play!

Each year the Australian Golf Croquet Men’s and Women’s Singles Championships are hosted by a different State, and Croquet West has the honour in 2016.

These two competitions will be held concurrently between Saturday 3 and Tuesday 6 September, and are bookended by the GC Gold Medal and the InterState Shield.

If you have a GC handicap of 8 or better you should consider putting in an entry!  

Over the four-day period, entrants will compete in seeded blocks (single 13-point games) and then – depending on numbers – either the top 16 or 32 move into a knockout playing best of three, while the remainder of the field contest for the Plate.

If you would like to ‘have a go’ but are ‘not quite sure’ then just enter the Plate.  Soak up the atmosphere, and watch Australia’s leading players as they get to the pointy end of the competition.
