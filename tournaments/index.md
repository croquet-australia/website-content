The Centre has twelve full-sized courts and is the largest croquet facility in the Country.

The Men’s and Women’s Singles are bookended by the Gold Medal and Eire Cup.  The first day of the Gold Medal is Wednesday 9 March and the final day of the Eire Cup is Sunday 20 March.  The singles commence on Saturday 12 March and finish on Tuesday 15 March.

Registration is between 2 and 5pm on Friday 11 March which provides the opportunity for players to practise and familiarise themselves with the lawns and hoops.  The hoops being used are Quadways.

Please encourage other Players at your club to enter!  You could suggest, if there is some trepidation to compete in a National event, for their first experience they could play in the Plate only?  [Download](/ac-mens-womens-open-2015.pdf) print and place on your noticeboard!
