#Go West – Go Play!

Each year the Australian Golf Croquet Men’s and Women’s Singles Championships are hosted by a different State, and Croquet West has the honour in 2016.

These two competitions will be held concurrently between Saturday 3 and Tuesday 6 September, and are bookended by the GC Gold Medal and the InterState Shield.

If you have a GC handicap of 8 or better you should consider putting in an entry!  

Over the four-day period, entrants will compete in seeded blocks (single 13-point games) and then – depending on numbers – either the top 16 or 32 move into a knockout playing best of three, while the remainder of the field contest for the Plate.

If you would like to ‘have a go’ but are ‘not quite sure’ then just enter the Plate.  Soak up the atmosphere, and watch Australia’s leading players as they get to the pointy end of the competition.
