The competitive spirit is in the air as Golf Croquet Players across Australia prepare themselves to compete in the Australian Golf Croquet Open Doubles and Singles Championships being held at the Victorian Croquet Centre – the largest croquet-specific venue in the Southern Hemisphere.

Entries can be completed using the on-line forms.

The Doubles commence on Saturday 7 May and concludes on Tuesday 10 May.  Players will notice several improvements to the on-line doubles entry form and several options are offered –

1.  Pay entry fees for both yourself and your partner
Or
2.  Pay only for yourself.

**1  Paying for yourself and partner**

You will be asked to complete details for both yourself and your partner including respective phone contacts, email addresses and handicaps.  Once you have chosen your method of payment you will receive an automatically generated email acknowledging receipt of your registration and specific instructions for paying the entry fees.  Your partner will also receive an email confirming they too have been entered in the Golf Croquet Open Doubles.

**2  Paying for only yourself**

If paying just for yourself you will still be asked to nominate your partner and include their email address.  Once you have chosen your method of payment you will receive an automatically generated email acknowledging that your registration has been successful and includes specific instructions for paying your entry fee.  Your partner will also receive an email advising them that they have been entered in the Golf Croquet Open Doubles but are also required to complete an entry on-line entry form and should list you as their partner.

In summary, if a player is paying for themselves and their partner only one entry form is required to be completed on-line.  If partners are paying individually, then each player is required to complete an on-line entry form and the two forms together will form one doubles pairing.

If a player wishing to play in the Doubles and is yet to find a partner please contact Peter Freer, Chair of the Events Committee by (mailto:events@croquet-australia.com.au)[email] before making an on-line entry.

The presentations after the conclusion of the Doubles provides an opportunity for players to wish bon voyage and bonne chance to the Golf Croquet Team – Chris McWhirter (Captain), Wendy Dickson, Anne Quinn and Lester Hughes with John van der Touw (Team Manager and Playing Reserve) – who are representing Australia at the GC Teams World Championship.  The five leave from Tullamarine later that night.

The Singles Competition begins on Wednesday 11 May and finishes on Sunday 15 May and the on-line entry form is also live.

If players have any concerns or difficulties with their on-line entries please contact Peter Freer, Chair of the Events Committee by (mailto:events@croquet-australia.com.au)[email].

CLOSING DATE FOR ENTRIES IS THURSDAY 21 APRIL – Midnight WA time
