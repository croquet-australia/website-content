Regional Insurance Brokers is proud to be in partnership with the Australian Croquet Association as its official corporate insurance broker.

Regional has been working in close partnership with the sports and leisure industry in Australia for many years.  This experience has enabled Regional to develop an insurance and risk protection program that specifically meets the needs of the Australian Croquet Association.  We are able to identify and address the association’s risk exposures and in conjunction with various insurers, provide a comprehensive insurance program that is specifically targeted to the sport of croquet.

We recognise the importance of working alongside our clients to develop an insurance solution that addresses your physical, legal and financial risks.

**Public Liability**

Public liability insurance is designed to protect you against losses that you become legally liable to pay as compensation in respect of personal injury and/or property damage that occurs as a result of your club’s business. Club business includes activities associated with the administration, promotion, organisation and provision of croquet. This includes the ownership or occupation of your premises, and fundraising events.

**Professional Indemnity**

This policy will cover you against losses arising out of a claim against you arising out of a breach of
professional duty including negligent acts and advice in the conduct of the club business.

**Management Liability**

Management liability insurance provides cover against the exposures and unintentional wrongdoings that your club may face.  This includes discrimination, harassment, inefficient administration, libel and slander, and employee theft.

This policy provides cover to the elected officers and incorporated sporting clubs for losses arising
from claims against the officer/sporting club for wrongful acts that have been committed in the conduct of club business.
The policy includes the following coverage sections:
<br/>•	Directors and Officers Liability
<br/>•	Employment Practices Liability
<br/>•	Internet Liability
<br/>•	Statutory Liability
<br/>•	Fidelity

**Personal Accident**

This policy provides coverage for members that are injured whilst participating in official club matches, and whilst travelling to or from official club activities.  The policy generally provides cover in three key areas:
<br/>•	Capital Benefits
<br/>•	Non-Medicare Medical Benefits
<br/>•	Loss of Income

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

**Are volunteers covered?**
The personal accident policy includes cover for volunteers at the club carrying out general maintenance duties such as gardening.

**Does our liability policy cover club activities such as sausage sizzle fundraisers at third party sites?**
Yes. The policy automatically provides cover for basic fundraising activities.

**Are we insured if our club hires out our facilities to third parties?**
If your club hires out its facilities to third parties for activities other than your own, then there is a
requirement for you to ensure that those who use your facilities have their own liability insurance.
This can easily be confirmed by requesting that the third party supplies you with a certificate of
currency for their liability insurance as proof of cover.

**Is there a requirement to wear footwear whilst playing?**
Whilst there is no insurance requirement for footwear to be worn during matches, we recommend
that you implement and follow an effective risk management policy.
Some clubs have policies and procedures in place that require you to have footwear on at all times
and we recommend your abide by their policies.

**Is there a weather policy that we must comply with?**
We recommend that you follow your local state or territory governing policy.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

**Risk Management**
<br/>Risk Management assists you identity, prioritise and address risks that will affect the future of your
club and its members.
Each and every club must ensure that they have implemented a suitable program which provides a
systematic approach to managing risk. The program should address physical, legal and financial risk,
particularly in areas such as safety of both people and property, and compliance.
The development of an effective risk management program is an on-going process, and must be
continually monitored and reviewed to ensure that it meets your clubs individual needs.
Effective risk management ultimately means quality assurance for all of your players, coaches,
volunteers and spectators.
