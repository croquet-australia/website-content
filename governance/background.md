###New Governance Structure

The Australian Croquet Association (ACA) has been incorporated in the ACT since 10 February, 1992.  Prior to the Annual General Meeting held on Monday 23 March, 2015, the Association had a Council consisting of twelve delegates, two from each State Association and an Executive charged with its day to day operation.  The State Associations are –

<br/>Croquet New South Wales Incorporated (includes the ACT)
<br/>Croquet Association Queensland Incorporated 
<br/>South Australian Croquet Association Incorporated
<br/>Tasmanian Croquet Association Incorporated
<br/>The Victorian Croquet Association Incorporated
<br/>The West Australian Croquet Association Incorporated

<br/>At the AGM, Council unanimously adopted the new [Constitution](/aca-constitution-9-april-2015.pdf). It is a requirement that any change to an Association’s Model Rules be lodged with the ACT Office of Regulatory Services.  Approval was received and from Thursday 9 April, 2015, the Australian Croquet Association moved from an Executive and Council to a Board Structure.

To assist with the transition the new Constitution outlined the makeup of the Board for its first year – three of the First Directors were to come from the Executive (President, Senior Vice President and Vice-President) and the remaining six to be selected by their State Association.  

Members of the Board are 

<br/>Robyn Wallace, NSW - Chair
<br/>Jim Clement, VIC
<br/>Bob Godfrey, TAS
<br/>David Taylor, SA
<br/>Megan Fardon, WA
<br/>Don Close, QLD
<br/>Jim Saunders - came across from the Executive as elected Senior Vice President
<br/>Tricia Vierra - came across from the Executive as elected Vice President

The President resigned from the Board not wanting to take up a First Director position to pursue his love of croquet by playing the game rather than the being part of its management.  Under the Constitution the Board may operate with between seven and nine members.  

Members of the ACA are the six State Associations and each will appoint a delegate to attend Special General Meetings and Annual General Meetings.  Members of the Board in attendance at these meetings do not have a vote.

Why was a new Constitution required?

The ACA is the national peak body of Croquet in Australia and in order to be eligible to seek funding a number of improvements need to occur to ensure that the association is working under a best practice governance model.


In line with its Strategic Plan, the Constitutional Review Working Group (CRWG) consisting of a representative from each State was established and tasked with writing a document that was based on the Australian Sports Commission’s – 
<br/>Constitution Template
<br/>Mandatory Sports and Governance Principles
<br/>Governance Principles
The group initially thought the new constitution would allow ACA to become a company limited by guarantee and as part of the background research, Hockey Australia’s constitution was examined but it was soon realised taking ACA away from an incorporated association was a step too far in the first instance.  Constitutions belonging to similar sized sports were also examined such as Pétanque Federation of Australia and Australian Canoeing Inc.

The CRWG after intensive discussion, consultation and much hard work completed their remit within three months – a huge achievement.  Many thanks to Steve Thornton (NSW) Chair, Jim Saunders (VIC), Heather White (SA), Brad Maguire (WA), Tricia Vierra (TAS) and Murray Tinker (QLD).
