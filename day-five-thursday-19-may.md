We had a good first day of our two-day final against Spain. We are leading five matches to one, and need to win just two of the seven matches scheduled for tomorrow. Here's hoping we can play as well tomorrow as we did today. The Spanish players more or less matched us in clearances and placements but they were very hesitant when going for hoops. They often cleared us in situations where we would have gone for the hoop.
